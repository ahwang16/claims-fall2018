Directory structure:
====================

    model		containing CRF chunking model trained on Penn Treebank
    samples		containing sample input data files
    src			containing source code files
    Makefile		make file
    crfchunker.jar	binary libarary (output of compiling process)
    README		this one


How to compile:
===============

    make clean
    make all
    

How to test:
============

    make test
    
    after testing, go to samples directory to see the outputs
    

How to use CRFChunker:
=====================

    command line:
    
    case 1:
	
	java -mx512MB -classpath <CLASSPATH> crf.chunker.CRFChunker -modeldir <MODELDIR> -inputfile <INPUTFILE>
	
    case 2:
    
	java -mx512MB -classpath <CLASSPATH> crf.chunker.CRFChunker -modeldir <MODELDIR> -inputdir <INPUTDIR>
	
    where:
	
	-mx512MB: to extend heap memory for JVM
	
	<CLASSPATH> is the path to the "crfchunker.jar" file. For instance, if we are currently at the home 
	directory of CRFChunker, the <CLASSPATH> is "./crfchunker.jar"
	
	<MODELDIR> is the path to the trained model. For instance, if we are currently at the home directory
	of CRFChunker, the <MODELDIR> is "./model"
	
	<INPUTFILE> is the input data file with the format as follows:
	    - plain text file
	    - one sentence on each line
	    
	<INPUTDIR> is the directory contain multiple input data files. This option is useful when we 
	need to tag a lot of documents without loading the model multiple times. This helps reduce 
	computational time dramatically.
	
	NOTE: the output of CRFTagger (http://sourceforge.net/projects/crftagger) can be used directly as
	input data for CRFChunker
	

    example:
    
	if we are currently at the top (home) directory of CRFChunker and we would like to tag an input
	data file named "input.txt.pos" which is also located at the top directory of CRFChunker, we perform:
	
	java -mx512MB -classpath ./crfchunker.jar crf.chunker.CRFChunker -modeldir ./model -inputfile ./input.txt.pos
	
	the output will be "input.txt.pos.chk"
